IoT-Based Automatic Medicine Reminder and Dispenser Box
📌 Project Overview

The IoT-Based Automatic Medicine Reminder and Disenser Box is a smart healthcare solution designed to help patients take medicines on time without manual supervision. The system automatically alerts the user with a buzzer, opens the correct medicine box, and sends real-time mobile notifications using Arduino Cloud.

This project is especially useful for:

Elderly patients

Busy individuals

Hospitals and home care

Chronic disease patients

🎯 Objectives

Automate medicine reminders for fixed daily schedules

Reduce missed doses and human error

Provide remote control via mobile application

Improve healthcare adherence using IoT technology

⚙️ System Features

✅ Automatic medicine reminders at:

Breakfast – 08:00 AM

Lunch – 01:30 PM

Dinner – 08:00 PM

✅ Rhythmic buzzer alert when reminder is due
✅ Automatic opening of correct medicine box for 5 minutes
✅ Mobile notification via Arduino Cloud
✅ Manual control from mobile app
✅ Real-time clock-based scheduling
✅ LCD display for system status and current time
